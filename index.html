            <h2>What is Love2D?</h2>
            <div class="info-content">
                <p>Love2D is a framework based on Lua, whose main goal is to make the process of creating games easier and funnier. It’s important to remember that Lua is a scripting language, so all game logic can be easily distributed by different script files or groups, which allows you to control code growth without serious efforts. Another one point about Lua is that it doesn’t have a straight definition of paradigm: there is something like a combination of functional and objected-oriented programming, caused by special data type — ‘tables’ which can replace objects, arrays, and even generics. Some people hate this, telling that such tricks just destroy logical connections in the project, some people love tables because of their simplicity.</p>
                <p>And last but not least is fact that Love was specially made for work with graphics, containing hundreds of functions to change parameters like image scale, rotation, moving, transforming without serious artifacts appearing (this problem is well known in Game Maker: Studio, for example: changing calling the function of image rotation from code with speed-parameter causes horrible graphics deterioration, like sharp pixel edges emerging). Sooth to say, there is no text console in Love, only app window — there’s no difference between text or graphics if you wanna display ‘em.</p>
